## Implementation Details

### Security Workflow Integration

The security scanning is integrated into the CI pipeline through multiple layers:

1. **Pre-commit**: ESLint security rules catch issues during development
2. **PR Creation**: Automated scans run on every pull request
3. **Merge**: Branch protection ensures all security checks pass
4. **Post-merge**: Continuous monitoring and dependency updates

### Quality Gates

Quality gates are enforced at multiple stages:

1. **Linting**: Security-focused ESLint rules
2. **Testing**: 80% coverage threshold enforcement
3. **Analysis**: SonarCloud quality gate requirements
4. **Security**: All vulnerability scans must pass

### Performance Monitoring

The pipeline includes comprehensive performance tracking:

1. **Real-time**: Job execution time monitoring
2. **Historical**: Trend analysis over the last 50 runs
3. **Regression Detection**: Automatic alerts for performance degradation
4. **Reporting**: Detailed performance summaries with recommendations
