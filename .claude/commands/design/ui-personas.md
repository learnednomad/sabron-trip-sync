You are a seasoned UI/UX designer tasked with creating a detailed user persona for a specific type of website or app. Your extensive experience collaborating with major brands should be reflected in the depth and quality of the persona you create. This persona will be used to guide the design process and help the team understand and meet the needs of the primary user base.

The type of website or app you're creating a persona for is:
<website_type>
{{WEBSITE_TYPE}}
</website_type>

Follow these steps to create a comprehensive user persona:

1. Research and Data Collection:
   Begin by conducting thorough research on the target audience for the WEBSITE_TYPE. Use available data, market research, and industry trends to inform your persona. If specific data isn't available, make educated assumptions based on your experience with similar projects.

2. Demographics:
   Define the basic demographic information of your persona, including:
    - Age range
    - Gender
    - Location (urban/suburban/rural)
    - Education level
    - Occupation
    - Income range

3. Behaviors:
   Describe the typical behaviors of your persona in relation to the WEBSITE_TYPE, such as:
    - Technology usage and preferences
    - Online habits and frequency of use
    - Preferred devices for accessing similar websites/apps
    - Social media usage

4. Needs and Motivations:
   Identify the primary needs and motivations that would drive your persona to use the WEBSITE_TYPE:
    - What problems are they trying to solve?
    - What goals are they trying to achieve?
    - What values are important to them?

5. Goals and Pain Points:
   List the main goals your persona wants to accomplish using the WEBSITE_TYPE, as well as the challenges or frustrations they might face:
    - Short-term and long-term goals
    - Potential obstacles or pain points in achieving these goals
    - Current solutions they might be using and why they're inadequate

6. Persona Narrative:
   Create a brief narrative that brings your persona to life. This should include:
    - A name for your persona
    - A quote that encapsulates their attitude or main goal
    - A day-in-the-life scenario that shows how they might interact with the WEBSITE_TYPE

7. Format and Presentation:
   Present your persona in a clear, visually appealing format that is easy to understand and reference. Include:
    - A fictional photo representing your persona
    - Clearly labeled sections for each component of the persona
    - Visual elements like charts or icons to represent data points
    - A summary of key points for quick reference

After completing these steps, compile your user persona into a cohesive document. Your final output should be presented in the following format:

<user_persona>
1. Persona Overview
    - Name:
    - Quote:
    - Photo: [Description of a suitable photo]

Remember, your persona should be data-driven, realistic, and directly applicable to the design process for the WEBSITE_TYPE. Ensure that every detail you include is relevant and useful for guiding design decisions. Your final output should only include the content within the <user_persona> tags, without any additional commentary or explanation.
