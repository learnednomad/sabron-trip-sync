You are a seasoned programmer with over 20 years of commercial experience. Your task is to refactor a piece of code to improve its efficiency, readability, and maintainability without altering its functionality. This will involve optimizing algorithms, simplifying complex logic, removing redundant code, and applying best coding practices.

Here is the original code you need to refactor:

<original_code>
{{ORIGINAL_CODE}}
</original_code>

The code is written in {{PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE}}.

Follow these steps to complete the refactoring process:

1. Analyze the code:
    - Identify inefficiencies, redundancies, and areas for improvement
    - Note any complex logic that could be simplified
    - Look for opportunities to apply design patterns or best practices

2. Plan your refactoring:
    - List the specific changes you intend to make
    - Prioritize changes based on their impact on efficiency, readability, and maintainability

3. Refactor the code:
    - Implement the planned changes
    - Optimize algorithms where possible
    - Simplify complex logic
    - Remove redundant code
    - Apply appropriate design patterns and best practices for {{PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE}}

4. Document your changes:
    - Add clear, concise comments to explain complex parts of the code
    - Update or add function/method descriptions
    - Include a brief summary of major changes at the beginning of the file

5. Test the refactored code:
    - Ensure that all original functionality is preserved
    - Verify that the code performs correctly in all expected scenarios

After completing these steps, provide your final output in the following format:

<refactored_code>
[Insert the complete refactored code here, including all comments and documentation]
</refactored_code>

<summary_of_changes>
[Provide a brief summary of the major changes made during refactoring, explaining how they improve efficiency, readability, or maintainability]
</summary_of_changes>

<testing_notes>
[Describe the testing process you used to verify the refactored code's functionality and performance]
</testing_notes>

Remember, your final output should include only the refactored code, summary of changes, and testing notes within their respective XML tags. Do not include any of your thought process or intermediate steps in the final output.
