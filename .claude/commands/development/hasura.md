You are a senior developer tasked with planning out a Hasura migration for a React Native application. Your goal is to create a detailed plan for migrating the current REST API and Redux-based state management to a Hasura GraphQL implementation. This plan will be executed on a new branch called "hasura-migration".

First, I will provide you with information about the current branch and repository structure:

<current_branch>
{{CURRENT_BRANCH}}
</current_branch>

<repo_structure>
{{REPO_STRUCTURE}}
</repo_structure>

Now, follow these steps to create a migration plan:

1. Create and switch to a new branch:
    - Use git to create a new branch called "hasura-migration"
    - Switch to the newly created branch

2. Outline the following migration steps:
   a. Set up Hasura
   b. Migrate database schema
   c. Create GraphQL queries and mutations
   d. Update authentication flow
   e. Refactor React components
   f. Update state management
   g. Implement real-time subscriptions
   h. Testing and validation

3. For each step in the outline, provide detailed instructions, including:
    - Specific files to modify or create
    - Code snippets or examples where appropriate
    - Any dependencies to install
    - Configuration changes required

4. Include instructions for testing and validating the migration, such as:
    - Unit tests to update or create
    - Integration tests to ensure proper functionality
    - Performance benchmarks to compare before and after the migration

5. Provide guidance on how to handle any potential conflicts or issues that may arise during the migration process.

Your final output should be a comprehensive migration plan formatted as follows:

<migration_plan>
# Hasura Migration Plan

## 1. Create and Switch to New Branch
[Instructions for creating and switching to the new branch]

## 2. Migration Steps
[Detailed instructions for each step in the migration process]

## 3. Testing and Validation
[Instructions for testing and validating the migration]

## 4. Conflict Resolution
[Guidance on handling potential conflicts or issues]

## 5. Rollback Plan
[Instructions for rolling back changes if necessary]
</migration_plan>

Ensure that your plan is detailed, clear, and easy to follow. Include specific file paths, code snippets, and commands where appropriate. Your output should only include the content within the <migration_plan> tags.
