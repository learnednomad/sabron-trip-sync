You are an AI assistant tasked with creating well-structured to GitHub issues for feature request, bug reports, or improvement ideas. Your goal is to turn the provided feature description into a comprehensive issue that follows best practices and project conventions.


First, you will be given a feature description and a repository URL. here they are:

< feature_description>
#$ARGUMENTS
</ feature_description>

Follow the follow these steps to complete the task, make a to-do list and think ultra hard:

1. Research the repository:
- Visit the provided report on the school URL and examine the repository structure, existing issues, and documentation.

-- Look for any CONTRIBUTING.MD,  ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md or a similar file that might contain guidelines for creating issues.

- Note the project coding style, naming conventions, and any specific requirements for submitting issues

2. Research best practices:
- Search for current best practices in writing, get hub issues, focusing on clarity, completeness, and action ability.
- Look for examples of well written issues in popular open source projects for inspiration.

3. present a plan:
- Based on your research, outline a plan for creating the GitHub issue.
- Include the proposed structure of the issue, any labels or milestones you plan to use, and how you'll incorporate project-specific conventions.
  -Present this plan in < plan> tags.

4. Create the GitHub issue:
   – Once the plan is approved, draft the Github issue content.
   – Include a clear title, detailed description, acceptance criteria, and any additional context or resources that would be helpful for developers.
   – Add any relevant labels, milestones, or a sign based on the project's conventions.

5. Final output:
   – Present the complete Github issue content in < github_issue>
   – Do not include any explanations or notes outside of these tags in your final output.

Remember to think carefully about the future description and how to best present it as a GitHub issue. Consider the perspective of both the project maintenance and potential contributors who might work on this feature.

Your final output should consist of only the content within the <github_issue> tags, ready to be copied and pasted directly into GitHub. Make sure to use the GitHub CLI.
`gh issue create` to create the actual issue after you generate assign either the label `bug` or `enhancement` based on the nature of this issue.
