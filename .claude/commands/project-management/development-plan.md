You are an experienced software architect and project manager tasked with developing a comprehensive implementation plan for a project called Sabron-Trip-Sync. This project includes both a mobile app and a web dashboard. Your goal is to create a detailed, practical plan that aligns closely with the provided requirements and incorporates best practices for both mobile and web development.

First, carefully read and analyze the Sabron-Trip-Sync requirements document provided below:

<sabron_trip_sync_requirements>
{{TRAVELSYNC_REQUIREMENTS}}
</sabron_trip_sync_requirements>

After thoroughly reviewing the requirements, you will develop an implementation plan. For each major section of the plan, wrap your analysis in <section_analysis> tags inside your thinking block. This will ensure a comprehensive and well-reasoned approach.

In your section analysis and final plan, be sure to:
1. Consider both the mobile app and web dashboard aspects of the project.
2. Incorporate NextJS best practices for the web dashboard and Obytes best practices for the mobile app.
3. Think through potential improvements to the requirements and document them in the plan.
4. Focus on feature-based implementation, building out the app systematically.

Your final output should be structured as follows:

<development_plan>
1. Project Overview
2. Implementation Phases
   2.1 Phase 1: [Name]
   - Tasks
   - Timeline
   - Resources
   2.2 Phase 2: [Name]
   ...
3. Technical Architecture
4. Testing Strategy
5. Deployment and Maintenance
6. Required User Variables
7. Proposed Improvements
   </development_plan>

For each section of the development plan, first use <section_analysis> tags inside your thinking block to:
- List key features and requirements for both the mobile app and web dashboard relevant to that section.
- Identify potential challenges or risks for each major component.
- Suggest initial ideas for improvements or optimizations.

Then, present the final content for that section. Here's an example of how to structure your response:

<section_analysis>
[Your detailed analysis for the Project Overview section, including key features, challenges, and improvement ideas]
</section_analysis>

1. Project Overview
   [Your final content for the Project Overview section]

<section_analysis>
[Your detailed analysis for the Implementation Phases section, including key features, challenges, and improvement ideas]
</section_analysis>

2. Implementation Phases
   [Your final content for the Implementation Phases section]

... [continue this pattern for each section] ...

Ensure that your plan is detailed, practical, and aligns closely with the provided requirements. Pay special attention to the integration of mobile and web components, and document any proposed improvements or optimizations.

In the "Required User Variables" section, list all the variables that a user needs to provide for a smooth and seamless development process. Explain why each variable is necessary and how it will impact the development.

Your output should consist of only the content within the <development_plan> tags; do not include any additional commentary or notes outside of these tags. Do not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the section analysis portions.

Remember to consistently use the project name "Sabron-Trip-Sync" throughout your plan, as this is the correct name for the project.
