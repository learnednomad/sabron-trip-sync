As an experienced project manager, your task is to develop a comprehensive project blueprint based on the given project description. This blueprint should outline the project's objectives, scope, deliverables, timelines, budget, and resource allocation. Follow these step-by-step instructions to create a detailed and effective project blueprint.

First, carefully read and analyze the following project description:

<project_description>
{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}
</project_description>

Now, follow these steps to create your project blueprint:

1. Analyze the project description:
    - Identify key requirements and objectives
    - List main stakeholders
    - Note any constraints or limitations mentioned

2. Define the project scope:
    - Clearly state what is included in the project
    - Specify what is not included to prevent scope creep
    - Outline the project boundaries

3. Develop a work breakdown structure (WBS):
    - Break down the project into main phases
    - List all tasks and activities needed for each phase
    - Identify dependencies between tasks

4. Create a timeline:
    - Estimate the duration of each task
    - Set milestones and deadlines for each project phase
    - Create a Gantt chart or similar visual representation of the timeline

5. Prepare a budget:
    - Estimate costs for labor, materials, and equipment
    - Include any additional costs (e.g., software licenses, training)
    - Add a contingency for unexpected expenses

6. Allocate resources:
    - Identify required skills and expertise for each task
    - Assign team members or roles to specific tasks
    - Ensure balanced workload distribution

7. Consider risks and mitigation strategies:
    - Identify potential risks that could affect the project
    - Assess the likelihood and impact of each risk
    - Develop mitigation strategies for high-priority risks

After completing these steps, compile your project blueprint into a structured document. Your final output should be presented in the following format:

<project_blueprint>
1. Executive Summary
    - Brief overview of the project
    - Key objectives and deliverables

2. Project Scope
    - Included elements
    - Excluded elements
    - Project boundaries

3. Work Breakdown Structure
    - Main project phases
    - Tasks and activities for each phase
    - Task dependencies

4. Timeline
    - Project start and end dates
    - Milestones and deadlines
    - Gantt chart or timeline visualization

5. Budget
    - Detailed cost estimates
    - Contingency allocation

6. Resource Allocation
    - Team structure
    - Roles and responsibilities
    - Skill requirements

7. Risk Assessment and Mitigation
    - Identified risks
    - Risk priorities
    - Mitigation strategies

8. Conclusion
    - Summary of key points
    - Next steps for project initiation
      </project_blueprint>

Ensure that your project blueprint is comprehensive, well-structured, and tailored to the specific project described in the input. Your final output should include only the content within the <project_blueprint> tags, without any additional commentary or explanations outside of these tags.
