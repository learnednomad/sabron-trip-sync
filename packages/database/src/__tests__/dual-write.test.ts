// TODO: Reimplement dual-write tests for Supabase migration
// This test file needs to be updated to work with Supabase instead of Prisma

/*
// Original Prisma-based test implementation has been commented out
// since we migrated from Prisma to Supabase client.
// 
// The dual-write functionality may need to be reconsidered in the context
// of Supabase, as Supabase handles many aspects of data consistency and
// replication internally.
//
// If dual-write functionality is still needed, tests should be rewritten
// to work with Supabase client and appropriate backup strategies for Supabase.
