- **Problem-solving**: Systematic approach, security-conscious, performance-oriented

**Questions for Each AI**:
1. "What programming languages and frameworks do you excel at?"
2. "Are you stronger in frontend, backend, mobile, or full-stack development?"
3. "What types of development tasks energize you most?"
4. "How do you approach complex technical problems?"

### Round 2: TravelSync Fit Assessment
"Now let's discuss how your strengths align with the TravelSync project."

**Questions for Discussion**:
1. "Given the TravelSync architecture, which components would you be most excited to work on?"
