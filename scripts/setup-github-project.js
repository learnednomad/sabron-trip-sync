- Screen reader support functional
- Performance metrics meet requirements (< 2s load time)

## üîß Technical Implementation
\`\`\`typescript
// Authentication schema
const loginSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email('Invalid email address'),
  password: z.string().min(8, 'Password must be at least 8 characters'),
});

// Biometric authentication
const authenticateWithBiometrics = async () => {
  const result = await LocalAuthentication.authenticateAsync({
    promptMessage: 'Sign in to Sabron-Trip-Sync',
    fallbackLabel: 'Use Password',
  });
  return result.success;
};

- Use Sabron-Trip-Sync color scheme and typography
- Ensure minimum 48px touch targets
- Support both light and dark modes
- Include haptic feedback for interactions
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Consistent spacing using design tokens

## üìä Success Metrics
- Form validation prevents 100% of invalid submissions
- Authentication success rate > 95%
- Average authentication time < 3 seconds
- Accessibility score > 95%
- User satisfaction rating > 4.5/5

Design and implement the complete database schema for Sabron-Trip-Sync using Prisma ORM.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User and profile models defined
- [ ] Trip and itinerary models implemented
- [ ] Activity and location models created
- [ ] Visa and document models established
- [ ] Cultural content models designed
- [ ] Expense and financial models implemented
- [ ] Social features models (comments, likes, shares)
- [ ] Notification models created
- [ ] Database relationships properly defined
- [ ] Indexes optimized for performance
- [ ] Data validation rules implemented
- [ ] Migration scripts created and tested

## üéØ Definition of Done
- All models compile without errors
